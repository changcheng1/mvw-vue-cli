# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a command-line tool that generates Vue 3 project templates with modern tooling. The tool will be similar to create-vue but specifically configured with Vue 3, Vite, Ant Design Vue, and TypeScript. It will provide an interactive command-line experience using inquirer to allow users to customize their project setup through a series of questions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run a single command to generate a new Vue 3 project template, so that I can quickly start development with a pre-configured setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the CLI command THEN the system SHALL initiate the project generation process
2. WHEN the generation process starts THEN the system SHALL display a welcome message and project information
3. WHEN the project generation completes THEN the system SHALL create a new directory with the specified project name
4. WHEN the project is generated THEN the system SHALL include Vue 3, Vite, Ant Design Vue, and TypeScript as core dependencies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to interactively configure my project options through command-line prompts, so that I can customize the template to my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CLI starts THEN the system SHALL prompt the user for the project name
2. WHEN the user provides a project name THEN the system SHALL validate it follows naming conventions
3. WHEN the project name is valid THEN the system SHALL prompt for additional configuration options
4. WHEN the user selects options THEN the system SHALL store these choices for template generation
5. IF the user provides an invalid project name THEN the system SHALL display an error message and re-prompt

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to choose from various optional features during setup, so that my project only includes the tools I need.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN prompted for CSS preprocessor THEN the system SHALL offer options between SCSS and Less
2. WHEN prompted for state management THEN the system SHALL ask if Pinia is needed
3. WHEN prompted for routing THEN the system SHALL ask if Vue Router is needed
4. WHEN the user selects CSS preprocessor THEN the system SHALL configure the appropriate preprocessor and dependencies
5. WHEN the user selects features THEN the system SHALL include corresponding dependencies and configuration files

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generated project to have a proper file structure and configuration, so that I can immediately start development without additional setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is generated THEN the system SHALL create a standard Vue 3 project structure
2. WHEN the project includes TypeScript THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate tsconfig.json files
3. WHEN the project includes Vite THEN the system SHALL generate a proper vite.config.ts file
4. WHEN Ant Design Vue is included THEN the system SHALL configure proper imports and styling
5. WHEN optional features are selected THEN the system SHALL generate corresponding configuration files

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the generated project to be immediately runnable, so that I can verify the setup works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project generation completes THEN the system SHALL install all dependencies automatically
2. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL provide instructions for running the project
3. WHEN the user runs the development server THEN the application SHALL start without errors
4. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL display a working Vue 3 application with Ant Design Vue components
5. IF dependency installation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery instructions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CLI tool to be globally installable and easy to use, so that I can access it from anywhere on my system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CLI tool is published THEN it SHALL be installable via npm globally
2. WHEN the tool is installed globally THEN it SHALL be accessible from any directory
3. WHEN the user runs the command without arguments THEN the system SHALL display help information
4. WHEN the user runs the command with --help flag THEN the system SHALL display detailed usage instructions
5. WHEN the user runs the command with --version flag THEN the system SHALL display the current version
